-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

IMPORTANT — Entity Name Normalization Rules:
- Always use the FULLEST, most complete form of a name found anywhere in the document.
- Person names: If the document mentions "Blake T McCarn" and later refers to "Blake" or "McCarn", use "BLAKE T MCCARN" as the entity name for ALL references that clearly refer to that person.
- Organization names: Use the full official name. If "Internal Revenue Service" appears, use that instead of "IRS" (but note the abbreviation in the description).
- All entity names must be UPPERCASED.
- When a short name (e.g., a last name like "MCCARN") is AMBIGUOUS — meaning multiple people in the document share that name — do NOT resolve it to a specific person. Instead, use the short form as-is (e.g., "MCCARN") and note the ambiguity in the entity description.
- When a short name clearly refers to only one person based on context, resolve it to that person's full name.
- Apply the same normalization logic to organizations, addresses, and all other entity types.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, UPPERCASED, using the fullest canonical form (see normalization rules above)
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>

Text:
Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.
